This repo contains the MATLAB files for the proof of concept for the final year project, human-to-robot handovers using 5 DoF robot arm

Current tasks:
- Split into two modes of approach and grasp
- Get real data from a gyroscope and use it to generate a trajectory for the simulation arm to attempt to grasp

Completed tasks:
- Increase the size of frames (alternate solution of adding red dots to frames edges is done to improve visibility)
- Have the IK solver
- Can track a trajectory given the trajectory's position in x,y,z
- Visible robot arm
- Have both Mitsubishi arm and Habib arm simulations 
- Added orientation constraint
